# ModuleEditorV2
This was originally made by HTDBarsii, i just remade it

what it can do:
change a module script in a matter of seconds
copy the script that edits the module (for developers)
an explorer to find module scripts for you (its instant, so it might lag you a little if there are a lot of modules)
load a module script with a path
excludes roblox default module scripts
synapse x vibe
most of the time instant support
